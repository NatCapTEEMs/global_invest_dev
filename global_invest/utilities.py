"""Shared GEP utilities and cross-service conventions.

AGGREGATE ON r250, NEVER ON r264. r250 is one row per country (250 countries and territories) and is the
only correct key for sums, totals and the GEP CSV. r264 splits large countries into sub-regions -- China
x6, India x6, France/Turkey/UK/Pakistan x2 -- so summing r264 rows that carry a per-country value counts
those countries once per sub-region. If you need an r264 crosswalk (e.g. for a choropleth), filter it with
``ee_r264_label == iso3_r250_label`` so it collapses to one canonical row per country (the five provisioning
services do this; terrestrial_carbon/coastal_carbon instead sum on r250 and keep r264 only for the map).

Diagnostic -- if a national total is inflated by this, the gap decomposes exactly into China x6, India x6
and the four 2-way splits. A gap of any other shape is a legitimate sum, not this bug. This is how the bug
reached terrestrial_carbon + coastal_carbon and not the other five GEP services.
